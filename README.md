### Hi there 👋

🐍 Python developer. Once I started learning about coding and technology, I never stopped. I'm still looking for my passion and right now I think cloud computing will be that holy grail. I've done a lot of data work as a data scientist and text miner in the past. Something happened and now I'm working with @Simplicita as a Python developer / Data Scientist doing products for B2B.

Bachelor in Mechanical Engineer with studies in Data Science, Back end development with Python, FastAPI and Django. My latest academic achievement was to finish with honors the #DS4A correlation-one program, happy to be part of Platzi and Cloud Guru community of students and trying to find my voice with my personal blog https://diego-naranjo.super.site/. 

If you want to go from any career field to tech, text me! I will be happy to help you and learn with you. May be, my profesional and student background could help you to find a place in this industry.

Fluent in Spanish and English.
